## Seismographic Output
The files in this folder are automatically generated and contain the second-by-second output of seismographic data. They can be used for future projects and/or debugging.

The files are generated only if the config parameter `config.seismo.output` is set to `true`. There are three files generated each day for three different values: median, raw samples and filtered samples.
